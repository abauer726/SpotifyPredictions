# Spotify song popularity algorithm

We chose to explore Spotify music and the attributes that make a song popular because we all listen to music frequently and have specific songs that we enjoy. Something we’ve always wondered about is why we enjoy a particular song, and as a consequence, how certain songs become more popular over others. Is it the artist singing the song, the fact that we’ve heard it on the radio, the beats per minute, or is it whether the lyrics are explicit? To come up with a solution to these questions, we decided to create specific goals: get to know our data thoroughly, create visualizations of the attributes of our question, run regression models to find which attributes are most relevant, select and fine tune a model, and convey our results in an easily understandable report. This brings us to our research question: can we predict a song’s popularity based on its attributes?

Many current hits are actually created from machine learning algorithms. Whether they are enjoyable to listen to is another topic, but nevertheless these machine-created hits successfully used algorithms for lyrics, beats, timing, and other factors to make these song popular. We were inspired by this topic for our research question, especially when wondering which factors in these algorithms had the most weight in the song creation.
